# Smart Energy ML Analysis – JSI E3

This repository contains my personal contributions and experimental work developed during my collaboration with the Artificial Intelligence Department (E3) at the Jožef Stefan Institute, as part of the [HumAIne-JSI](https://github.com/HumAIne-JSI) project.

Official repository: [energy-ea](https://github.com/HumAIne-JSI/energy-ea)
